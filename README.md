# Analysis-of-DSQR-vs-GPSR-protocol-in-Vehicular-ad-hoc-networks
Distance and signal quality aware routing protocol(DSQR) is a Vehicular ad-hoc network protocol. Itâ€™s predecessor GPSR protocol is used in Vanets for data transmission. Developed this protocol as my third year "Computer Networks" semester project using Matlab. It is a modified geographical routing protocol using mid area node selection and signal quality to select the next hop forwarder.

The DSQR protocol is present in linkquality.m file 
Analysis of packets is calulated in perform_custom.m file
